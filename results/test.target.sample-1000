Shadow Cabinet ministers brand industry leaders as members of the '1%' Lord Prescott suggests they are 'tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms' One of them, Diageo boss Paul Walsh, 'should no longer take over at CBI' . 103 corporate leaders declared Government 'has been good for business' In September 2011, Miliband marks his first year as Labour leader by threatening a more punitive system of tax and regulation for businesses that he considers to be ‘predators’ who are ‘just interested in the fast buck’. The Institute of Directors says: ‘We would like to know how he plans to identify and reward “good” companies over “bad” ones. He should have more faith in customers and investors to decide’.

In February Miliband and his supporters turn on Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina when he dares to say he fears Labour’s business policies will be a catastrophe. Pessina is labelled a tax avoider from Monaco. Appalled business chiefs accuse the Labour leader of ‘playing the man not the ball’.
